ool-0.2.0 is released. This new release brings a new method (SPG). The
PGRAD and GENCAN were validated with the CUTEr test problem
suite. Most of the OOL Reference Manual was rewriten and/or
improved. Besides, two new chapters ("Quick Start" and "Brief
Theoretical Introduction") were included to the OOL Reference
Manual. Several bugs were fixed.

The Nonmonotone Spectral Gradient Method (SPG) is the third method
implemented in the OOL. This method is suited for minimization of
differentiable functions subjected to bound constraints. It is a
competitive algorithm with low memory requirements, with the spectral
steplength, a clever choice for the steplength which really improves
the convergence speed.

It is available in the CVS. A new realease is coming soon.
