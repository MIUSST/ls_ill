Quick introduction:

DLS

Single Sample:

Data of each file (one count at one angle) is saved in a class named DLS.Point.
The set of data files of different counts at different angles (single correlograms) is saved in an ARRAY of DLS.Point stored in a class DLS.Sample:
(DLS is not a class, but only a container (folder) where the DLS classes are stored : Point, Sample

A single data point can be accessed by DLS.Sample.Point(j).property or DLS.Sample.Point(j).method.
The same applies also to the results of the fitting which will be accessible by DLS.Sample.Point(i).Fit_<fitmethod>
where <fitmethod> stands for Double, Single, DoubleBKG, Cumulants...

Multiple Samples:

For multiple samples it is useful to have an array of DLS.Sample, as shown in the example file, 
where now the data at one angle can be accessed by arr_name(i).Point(j).property.

Fitting:

fitting can be performed on a whole dataset by Point.fit('fitmethod'), with fitmethod
as described above. Hence Sample can be fitted by arr_name(i).fit('fitmethod')
(do not try arr_name.fit() since arr_name is an array and has no method fit)

For further information on calling the Class DLS.Sample for data extraction and settings, 
please look at the example file and Class structure.

SLS

Data is saved as a SLS.Sample class, with similar structure as DLS.Sample, where SLS.Point stores the angle dependent
data values (mainly KcR) and SLS.Sample the info about sample and array of Angle, Q, SLS.Point...

%TODO: write small wiki page about program and main classes and functions.
