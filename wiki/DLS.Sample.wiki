=== Properties of Sample : assigned in Constructor ===
    * `Protein`       : Protein name.
    * `Salt`          : Salt name.
    * `C_set` [mg/ml] : protein concentration set in the ALV program.
    * `C`     [mg/ml] : real protein concentration.
    * `Cs`    [mM]    : salt concentration.
    * `n_set`         : refractive index set at measurement.
    * `n`             : refractive index -> for correction purpose.
    * `T`             : Temperature Set for experiment.
    * `Instrument`	  : Class of Type [[Instrument]].
=== Array Properties or Methods of all Points ===
    * `Point`              : Array of [[DLS.Point]].
    * `Q` [A^-1^]          : Array of unique scattering vector norm.
    * `Qv`[A^-1^]          : As above, assuring length of Point.
    * `Angle`              : Array of unique scattering angles.
